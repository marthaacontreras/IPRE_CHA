# IPRE_CHA

Welcome welcome to the IPRE's CHA project data analysis code 

To download the code into R Studio, download the RMD (R markdown) file: CHA1-3.Rmd. The reason why I did an RMD instead of R text file is because it can be easily exported to an HTML website which can be further easily published through GitHub. The idea is that this data and important findings will be able to be publishable and readily accessible to anyone on the internet. 

I uploaded all three CHA datasets and combined their individual data sheets into one data sheet per data set to facilitate data analysis. I didn't further combine these three datasets into one singular data sheet because of the different data parameters and limitations per data set received via FOIA requests.
