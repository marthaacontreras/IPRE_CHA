# IPRE_CHA

Welcome welcome to the IPRE's CHA project data analysis code 

I was not able to upload all data sets that the code works through because of their large size. Go to this Google Drive folder to download them:

The links can also be found on the HCV data timeline:

To download the code into R Studio, download the RMD (R markdown) file: CHA1-3.Rmd. The reason why I did an RMD instead of R text file is because it can be easily exported to an HTML website which can be further easily published through GitHub. The idea is that this data and important findings will be able to be publishable and readily accessible to anyone on the internet. 

I uploaded all three CHA datasets and combined their individual data sheets into one data sheet per data set to facilitate data analysis. I didn't further combine these three datasets into one singular data sheet because of the different data parameters and limitations per data set received via FOIA requests.

I also sifted through HUD census data for the most prevalent HCV vendor and tenant zip codesâ€”determined using the CHA2 dataset.
