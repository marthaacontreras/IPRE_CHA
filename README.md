# IPRE_CHA

Welcome welcome to the IPRE's CHA project data analysis code 

The first step is to download the datasets to begin using in this code. They are on the lefthand side of this terminal, where you will find all files on the main branch. Click each individual document and go to the download icon where you will download the raw file for each excel (".xlsx") file. 

You can also go to this Google Drive folder to download them:

The links can also be found on the HCV data timeline:

To download the code into R Studio, download the RMD (R markdown) file: CHA1-3.Rmd. Once downloaded, left click it and select to open in R Studio. The reason why I did an RMD instead of R text file is because it can be easily exported to an HTML website which can be further easily published through GitHub. The idea is that this data and important findings will be able to be publishable and readily accessible to anyone on the internet. 

I uploaded all three CHA datasets and combined their individual data sheets into one data sheet per data set to facilitate data analysis. I didn't further combine these three datasets into one singular data sheet because of the different data parameters and limitations per data set received via FOIA requests.

I also sifted through HUD census data for the most prevalent HCV vendor and tenant zip codesâ€”determined using the CHA2 dataset. 

In order to see the code used to analyze CHA1, dowload the HCV-Census.Rmd file and follow the same steps. That data analysis Github page with additional coding resources from the Dow Jones News Fund training camp can be found here:
